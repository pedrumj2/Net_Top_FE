# Net_Top_FE
Front and back End for the network topology project. 

# Net_Top_FE
The front end is written in html, css, javascript and Ajax. The backend is written in perl. The user selects a start time and a duration on the front end. After pressing the query button an ajax request is made to the back end. The back end contacts the database server and retrieves the network flows during that period. The front then displays the network topology as a graph.
